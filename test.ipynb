    "# Brain Tumor Classification: Model Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This script demonstrates how to load a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and use it to make predictions on a new image. The model is trained to classify images into \"no tumor\" and \"yes tumor\" categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cv2` (OpenCV): For image processing.\n",
    "- `keras`: For loading the pre-trained model.\n",
    "- `PIL` (Pillow): For image handling.\n",
    "- `numpy`: For numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Model Path:**\n",
    "   - `model_path`: Path to the pre-trained model file (`BrainTumor10EpochsCategorical.h5`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load the Model:**\n",
    "   - Use `load_model` from Keras to load the pre-trained model from the specified path.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load and Preprocess the Image:**\n",
    "   - `image_path`: Path to the image to be predicted (`pred13.jpg`).\n",
    "   - Load the image using `cv2.imread`.\n",
    "   - Check if the image was loaded correctly. Raise an error if the image file is not found.\n",
    "   - Convert the image to RGB format using `PIL`, resize it to `(64, 64)`, and convert it to a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prepare the Image for Prediction:**\n",
    "   - Expand dimensions of the image array to match the input shape expected by the model using `np.expand_dims`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Make a Prediction:**\n",
    "   - Use the `predict` method of the model to get the prediction for the preprocessed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Get the Predicted Class:**\n",
    "   - Determine the class with the highest probability using `np.argmax` on the prediction array.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Print the Predicted Class:**\n",
    "   - Output the predicted class to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script will print the predicted class for the given image. The output will be either `0` or `1`, corresponding to \"no tumor\" and \"yes tumor,\" respectively.\n"
